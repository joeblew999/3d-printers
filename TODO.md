GUI as well as CLI

https://github.com/guigui-gui/guigui is really easy to use.

We can combine it into the CLI, so that it opens automatically.
We need to carefully design it so that the CLi and GUI use the same code and stay dry.

Because many users are not developers i favout the GUI opening off the binary, and then devs can somehow use the same binary to work at the CLI level.
